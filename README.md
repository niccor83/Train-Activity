# Train-Activity
App that lets you see when trains will arrive.

*__What the project does:__ This is an app that allows a user to create a train name, destination, add a start time, and frequency and the app will calculate the number of minutes until the next train and the train arrival time based on the current time. The app will also store those entries in a firebase and display them in the train schedule section.

*__Why the project is useful:__ Building this app was useful because it helps the coder learn to push data to firbase database and display data from the database in a website.
